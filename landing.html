          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "HitPay is widely regarded as one of the best payment gateways for Singapore SMEs. It has zero monthly fees, zero setup costs, and supports PayNow — Singapore's most popular payment method. You only pay per transaction (0.65% + S$0.30 for PayNow, 2.8% + S$0.30 for cards). Compared to traditional bank gateways that charge S$30–100/month on top of transaction fees, HitPay is significantly more cost-effective for most small businesses."

There are no monthly fees, no setup fees, and no hidden charges. You only pay when you get paid. For PayNow QR payments, the rate is just 0.65% + S$0.30."

Once approved, you can generate PayNow QR codes, payment links, and a hosted checkout page that accepts PayNow at just 0.65% + S$0.30 per transaction.

Your customer clicks the link and pays — no account creation needed on their end. You can also send branded digital invoices with embedded payment buttons, or generate QR codes for in-person collection."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "A payment link is a URL you share to collect a specific payment — ideal for social sellers and service providers. An invoice is a formal billing document (with your branding and itemized breakdown) that includes a payment button — used for B2B or professional services. A payment gateway is embedded code on your website's checkout page — used for e-commerce stores. HitPay provides all three, and you can use whichever fits your business model."

International customers can pay with their local Visa, Mastercard, or AMEX cards, and HitPay handles currency conversion automatically.

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes. HitPay's Tap to Pay feature lets customers tap their contactless card or phone directly on your iPhone or Android device — no dedicated hardware needed at all. For businesses that prefer a dedicated device, HitPay's card terminal is just S$85 (a one-time purchase with no rental or monthly fees). This is significantly cheaper than most bank-provided terminals that cost S$300–500 plus monthly rental."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For Singapore SMEs, HitPay has key advantages over both: (1) PayNow support — HitPay natively supports PayNow at 0.65% + S$0.30, while PayPal doesn't support PayNow at all. (2) Lower fees for local methods — HitPay's PayNow rate is cheaper than Stripe's local payment rates. (3) No monthly fees — unlike some Stripe plans. (4) Singapore-based support team with local expertise. Stripe is better for complex technical integrations or global SaaS businesses; HitPay is better for Singapore SMEs wanting an all-in-one solution with fast setup and full local payment coverage."

          "text": "HitPay supports all major QR and alternative payment methods in Singapore through a single integration: PayNow QR (0.65% + S$0.30 — the lowest rate in market), GrabPay QR, ShopeePay, Alipay+, and WeChat Pay. There is no need to register separately with each e-wallet provider — HitPay aggregates them all. QR codes can be static (printed for your counter), dynamic (generated per transaction), or embedded in payment links and invoices."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "HitPay is one of the most comprehensive cross-border payment platforms for Southeast Asian businesses. It operates in 10+ countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and the United States. You can accept local payment methods in each market — including DuitNow in Malaysia, GCash in the Philippines, local wallets in Indonesia, and PromptPay in Thailand — all from a single HitPay account with no additional setup per country. Over 100 currencies are supported, and the platform handles FX automatically."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Omni-channel payment processing means accepting payments consistently across every sales channel your business uses — without managing multiple systems. HitPay provides a single platform covering: (1) Online checkout embedded in your website or e-commerce store; (2) Payment links shared via WhatsApp, Instagram, or email; (3) Invoices for B2B or service-based billing; (4) In-store POS via the HitPay app or card terminal; (5) QR codes for countertop or contactless collection; (6) Tap to Pay on iPhone or Android. All channels share one dashboard, one reporting view, and one bank account for payouts — making reconciliation effortless."

            From PayNow for Singaporeans, GrabPay for ride-hailing loyalists, ShopeePay for e-commerce shoppers, to Alipay+ for Chinese visitors and WeChat Pay for mainland tourists — one HitPay account enables them all automatically.

              HitPay is widely regarded as one of the best payment gateways for Singapore SMEs. It has zero monthly fees, zero setup costs, and supports PayNow — Singapore's most popular payment method. You only pay per transaction (0.65% + S$0.30 for PayNow, 2.8% + S$0.30 for cards). Compared to traditional bank gateways that charge S$30–100/month on top of transaction fees, HitPay is significantly more cost-effective for most small businesses.

              Yes, absolutely. HitPay's payment links let you collect payments without any website. Generate a unique URL in seconds, then share it via WhatsApp, Instagram DM, email, or Telegram. Your customer clicks the link and pays — no account creation needed on their end. You can also send branded digital invoices with embedded payment buttons, or generate QR codes for in-person collection.

              No — you don't need to be an incorporated company. HitPay accepts sole proprietors, freelancers, and individual sellers. You'll need a valid Singapore bank account and to complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification with your NRIC or business registration documents. Businesses registered as sole proprietorships with ACRA are fully eligible.

HitPay covers all six channels: <strong class="text-slate-800">online checkout</strong> (website), <strong class="text-slate-800">payment links</strong> (WhatsApp, social), <strong class="text-slate-800">invoicing</strong> (B2B billing), <strong class="text-slate-800">POS</strong> (in-store), <strong class="text-slate-800">QR codes</strong> (countertop), and <strong class="text-slate-800">Tap to Pay</strong> (mobile contactless).
